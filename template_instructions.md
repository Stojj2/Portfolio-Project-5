Codeanywhere Template Instructions

Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for Codeanywhere. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions. Click the Use this template button above to get started.

You can safely delete the Codeanywhere Template Instructions section of this README.md file, and modify the remaining paragraphs for your own project. Please do read the Codeanywhere Template Instructions at least once, though! It contains some important information about the IDE and the extensions we use.
How to use this repo

    Use this template to create your GitHub project repo

    Log into CodeAnywhere with your GitHub account.

    On your Dashboard, click on the New Workspace button

    Paste in the URL you copied from GitHub earlier

    Click Create

    Wait for the workspace to open. This can take a few minutes.

    Open a new terminal and pip3 install -r requirements.txt

    In the terminal type pip3 install jupyter

    In the terminal type jupyter notebook --NotebookApp.token='' --NotebookApp.password='' to start the jupyter server.

    Open port 8888 preview or browser

    Open the jupyter_notebooks directory in the jupyter webpage that has opened and click on the notebook you want to open.

    Click the button Not Trusted and choose Trust.

Note that the kernel says Python 3. It inherits from the workspace so it will be Python-3.8.12 as installed by our template. To confirm this you can use ! python --version in a notebook code cell.
Cloud IDE Reminders

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

    Log in to your Heroku account and go to Account Settings in the menu under your avatar.
    Scroll down to the API Key and click Reveal
    Copy the key
    In the terminal, run heroku_config
    Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the heroku CLI program - try running heroku apps to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you, so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with Regenerate API Key.
